# Federated Learning for Disaster Management via On-Board Satellite Data 
![small-raven](https://github.com/uvrey/l46-project/assets/77244149/5680348c-7d4e-4f32-9a37-0d9c113768d7)

## Overview
This project is presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for L46: Principles of Machine Learning Systems, and provides an implementation of federated learning on the RAEVEN dataset for change detection from on-board satellite data. In particular, we consider the capacity of federated learning to support disaster management with similar aims to the original paper. The contributions of this work are as follows:

- Determined the feasibility of federated learning on the RAEVEN dataset
- Recreated experiments to determine if the originally-selected parameters remain appropriate for a federated environment

## Set-up and Installation
The code may be compiled and executed as follows. 

`Do something here`

Then, something else happens. 

`Another code block here`

## Contributors
This project was developed by Luca Powell (LP647) and Josephine Rey (JMR239) as part of the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science programme, University of Cambridge, 2023. 

## Planning and Decision-Making
| Week | Date                | Actions   | Decisions |
| ------ | ------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Week 1 | December 12 - 18    | Compile reading list, assess literature, propose project ideas.  | Project topic          |
| Week 2 | December 19 - 25    | Read literature, create Miro board for detailed planning, set up GitHub repo, Colab training environment and report outline.   | Task allocation and project milestones.   |
| Week 3 | December 26 - January 1 | Prepare literature review, introduction and abstract. Investigate RAEven model files and devise strategy for feeding to Flower. | Experiment selection and risk mitigation strategy |
| Week 4 | January 2 - 8       | Intensify development efforts, begin experiments. Iteratively report on findings and incorporate within report. | Revised experiment selection |
| Week 5 | January 9 - 15      | Complete experiments, finalise report, devise figures and proofread. | Submission pipeline. |
