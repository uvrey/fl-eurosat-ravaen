# Federated Learning for Disaster Management via On-Board Satellite Data 
![small-raven](https://github.com/uvrey/l46-project/assets/77244149/5680348c-7d4e-4f32-9a37-0d9c113768d7)

## Overview
This project is presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for L46: Principles of Machine Learning Systems, and provides an implementation of federated learning on the RAEVEN dataset for change detection from on-board satellite data. In particular, we consider the capacity of federated learning to support disaster management with similar aims to the original paper. The contributions of this work are as follows:

- Determined the feasibility of federated learning on the RAEVEN dataset
- Recreated experiments to determine if the originally-selected parameters remain appropriate for a federated environment

## Set-up and Installation
The code may be compiled and executed as follows. 

`Do something here`

Then, something else happens.
